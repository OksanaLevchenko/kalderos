### Step-by-step instructions with code examples.

Step 1: Infrastructure Setup using Terraform
Cloud Storage (S3 Bucket):
Create a file named s3.tf with the following content:

**Code Snipped**

` provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1" # Update with your preferred region
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name" # Update with your desired bucket name
  acl    = "private"
} `


**Run Terraform commands to initialize and apply the configuration:**

terraform init
terraform apply
Message Queue Service (AWS SQS):
Create a file named sqs.tf with the following content:


**Code Snipped**

`provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1" 
}

resource "aws_sqs_queue" "my_queue" {
  name                      = "my-queue"
  delay_seconds             = 0
  max_message_size          = 2048
  message_retention_seconds = 345600
  visibility_timeout_seconds = 30
}`

**Run Terraform commands to apply the configuration:**

terraform apply
Containerization Infrastructure (Amazon EKS):
Create a file named eks.tf with the following content:

`provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1" # Update with your preferred region
}

module "eks" {
  source            = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"
  cluster_name      = "my-eks-cluster"
  cluster_version   = "1.21" # Update with your desired Kubernetes version
  subnets           = ["subnet-xxxxxx", "subnet-yyyyyy", "subnet-zzzzzz"] # Update with your subnets
  vpc_id            = "vpc-xxxxxx" # Update with your VPC ID
  node_groups = {
    eks_nodes = {
      desired_capacity = 2
      max_capacity     = 3
      min_capacity     = 1
      instance_type    = "t3.medium" # Update with your desired instance type
    }
  }
}
`

**Run Terraform commands to apply the configuration:**

terraform apply

### Step 2: CI/CD Strategy

Infrastructure Changes: Version-control Terraform scripts using Git. Set up a CI/CD pipeline triggered by changes to the Terraform codebase (e.g., using Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD).

Application Code: Version-control your Python script and Dockerfile. Use a CI/CD pipeline to build the Docker image and deploy it to the EKS cluster. This pipeline can be triggered by changes to the application code repository (e.g., using Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD).


### Step 3: Monitoring and Security Tools

Monitoring: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the Kubernetes cluster and application performance. Set up monitoring configurations and dashboards.

Security: Implement AWS security best practices such as IAM roles and policies, encryption at rest, and network security configurations. Use AWS Security Hub for security compliance checks.

### Step 4: Python Script in Container

Dockerize the Python Script:
Create a Dockerfile in the same directory as your Python script with the following content:

**Dockerfile**

`FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY script.py .

CMD ["python", "./script.py"]`


**Build the Docker image:**

docker build -t my-python-app .
Provide Instructions for Building and Running the Container:
Provide the following instructions to build and run the Docker container:


`# Build the Docker image
docker build -t my-python-app .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -d my-python-app
`
### Step 5: Test

Test the infrastructure setup by accessing the provisioned resources (S3 bucket, SQS queue, EKS cluster) and verifying the deployed Python script in the containerized environment.

### Step 6: Documentation

Document the step-by-step instructions for setting up the infrastructure, CI/CD pipeline, monitoring, security configurations, and Dockerization of the Python script. Include any relevant code snippets and configurations.
By following these steps, you can set up a foundational cloud-based infrastructure, implement a CI/CD strategy, select monitoring and security tools, and containerize the provided Python script. Let me know if you need further assistance or specific code examples for any part!
